# Map Container Initialization Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing an "Map container is already initialized" error when clicking on "Browse Listings". This error occurred because:

1. **React Strict Mode**: In development, React Strict Mode double-invokes effects, causing Leaflet to attempt initializing the same map container twice
2. **Component Re-renders**: When listings data changed, the MapView component re-rendered without properly cleaning up the previous map instance
3. **react-leaflet Issues**: The react-leaflet library has known issues with re-initialization in development mode

## Root Cause Analysis
- The error originated from the `MapContainer` component in react-leaflet
- React's development mode strict checks were triggering double initialization
- Insufficient cleanup of map instances during component unmounting
- Missing error boundaries for map-specific errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Replaced react-leaflet with Vanilla Leaflet**
- Created a new `SimpleMap` component using vanilla Leaflet instead of react-leaflet
- This eliminates the react-leaflet initialization conflicts
- Provides better control over map lifecycle management

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive error boundaries (`MapErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Implemented graceful error recovery with user-friendly retry options
- Added specific handling for map-related errors in `error.tsx`

### 3. **Improved Map Lifecycle Management**
- Proper cleanup of map instances on component unmount
- Unique IDs for each map container to prevent conflicts
- Safe initialization with proper error handling

### 4. **Created Reusable Components**
- `SimpleMap.tsx`: A robust, reusable map component
- `MapWrapper.tsx`: A wrapper with error boundaries and loading states
- `MapErrorBoundary.tsx`: Specific error boundary for map components

### 5. **Added Safety Measures**
- Dynamic imports to prevent SSR issues
- Proper Leaflet icon configuration
- CSS fixes for map rendering
- Loading states and error recovery

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/components/SimpleMap.tsx` - Main map component using vanilla Leaflet
- `src/components/MapWrapper.tsx` - Wrapper with error handling
- `src/components/MapErrorBoundary.tsx` - Map-specific error boundary
- `src/hooks/useMapSafeRender.ts` - Custom hook for safe map rendering
- `src/components/__tests__/SimpleMap.test.tsx` - Tests for the map component

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/listings/MapView.tsx` - Completely rewritten to use SimpleMap
- `src/components/NearbyAmenities.jsx` - Updated to use SimpleMap
- `src/app/listings/page.tsx` - Updated to use MapWrapper
- `src/app/error.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added Leaflet-specific CSS fixes

## Key Benefits

1. **Eliminated Initialization Errors**: No more "Map container is already initialized" errors
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user-friendly messages
3. **Improved Performance**: More efficient map rendering and cleanup
4. **Reusable Components**: Can be used throughout the application
5. **Better Development Experience**: Works properly in React Strict Mode

## Testing

The solution has been tested and verified:
- ✅ No more map initialization errors
- ✅ Proper error boundaries catch and handle map errors
- ✅ Maps load correctly on the listings page
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks when map loading fails
- ✅ Works in both development and production modes

## Usage

To use the new map components:

```tsx
import SimpleMap from '@/components/SimpleMap';

// Basic usage
<SimpleMap
  center={[43.7, -79.4]}
  zoom={10}
  height="600px"
  markers={[
    {
      position: [43.7, -79.4],
      popup: "Marker popup content"
    }
  ]}
/>

// With error boundary
import MapWrapper from '@/components/MapWrapper';

<MapWrapper
  listings={listings}
  className="w-full lg:w-1/2"
  style={{ minWidth: 350, minHeight: 600 }}
/>
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add map clustering for large numbers of markers
2. Implement custom marker icons
3. Add map controls (zoom, layers, etc.)
4. Add geolocation features
5. Implement map search functionality

The error has been completely resolved and the application now provides a robust, error-free mapping experience.
